## Assembly materials needed

* **10x** m2x8mm screws for the cases.
* **20x** m2x4mm screws for the plates (If you bought a sofle kit these should be included).
* **10x** m2x8mm standoffs for the pcbs (If you bought a sofle kit these should be included).
* **10x** m2x4x3.5mm heat-set threaded inserts to screw the cases together.
* **16x** 8mm rubber bumpons (optional).

## Changes to Pelicram's case

* Removed bottom contouring that created tenting
* Removed wrist rest support
* Enlarged hole for nice!nano and switch
* Added removable nice!view cover

## Please note

* The included knob is designed for the Alps EC11 encoder with a 15mm tall plum shaft.  [Such as this one.](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002767327743.html)
If you are using a different model you might have to use a different knob for your board.
* 3MF files are oriented for best print results and don't require supports.

## Assembly instructions

1. Assemble the Sofle keyboard like you would normally, but don't screw the fr4/acrylic bottom on. 
2. Instead screw the keyboard halves into `Bottom` with the `m2x4mm` screws.
3. Install the heat-set threaded inserts into the holes in `Top`.
4. Slot the case bottoms into the tops, and screw together with the `m2x8mm` screws.
5. Slot nice!view cover into `Top`
5. Install `Knob-X2` into the encoders.

## Special Thanks to

* Josef Adamcik for designing the original Sofle keyboard and making the project open source.
* kb-elmo for making the original version of this case and sharing the step files.
* Pelicram for modifying kb-elmo's design

These files are meant for 3D printing only! 

They are not suitable for CNC machining and trying to use them for that will most likely result in unusable parts.
